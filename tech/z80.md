## Key Concepts

### Z80 At a Glance

#### General Features
- **Clock Speed**: Ranges from 2.5 MHz to 6 MHz or higher, making it suitable for a variety of applications.
- **Instruction Set**: Rich with over 150 instructions, including extended instruction sets for enhanced performance.
- **Addressing Modes**: Supports multiple addressing modes (Immediate, Direct, Indexed, Register Indirect, etc.) for flexible data manipulation.

#### Registers
- **General-Purpose Registers**: 8-bit (A, B, C, D, E, H, L) and can be paired as 16-bit registers (BC, DE, HL) for operations.
- **Special Registers**: Include Accumulator (A), Flags register (F), Stack Pointer (SP), Program Counter (PC), two Index Registers (IX and IY), and Refresh Register (R).
- **Shadow Registers**: A set of alternate registers (A', B', C', D', E', H', L', and F') for rapid context switching, especially useful in interrupt handling.

#### Interrupt Handling
- **Modes**: Three interrupt modes (IM 0, IM 1, IM 2) providing versatility in response to external interrupts.
- **Interrupt Vector Table**: Used in IM 2 for indirect addressing of interrupt service routines, offering a more flexible interrupt handling mechanism.

#### Memory Management
- **Memory Space**: Addressable up to 64KB, with mechanisms for bank switching to extend beyond the 64KB limit in more advanced setups.
- **Refresh Register (R)**: Ensures dynamic RAM refreshes, facilitating the use of less expensive DRAM.

#### Key Operations
- **Bit Manipulation**: Instructions for bit set, reset, and test operations directly on memory or registers.
- **Block Operations**: Support for block move, search, and I/O operations, enabling efficient data handling.


### Registers

#### General-Purpose Registers
- **A (Accumulator):** Main register for arithmetic, logic, and data transfer operations.
- **B, C, D, E, H, L:** General-purpose registers, can be paired as BC, DE, HL for operations requiring 16-bit data or addresses.

#### Special-Purpose Registers
- **PC (Program Counter):** Holds the address of the next instruction to execute.
- **SP (Stack Pointer):** Points to the current top of the stack.
- **IX, IY:** Index registers for offset addressing modes.

#### Flag Register (F)
- Bit 7. **S (Sign):** Indicates the sign of the result of an operation.
- Bit 6. **Z (Zero):** Set if the result of an operation is zero.
- Bit 5. **not used**
- Bit 4. **H (Half Carry):** For BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) operations.
- Bit 3. **not used**
- Bit 2. **P/V (Parity/Overflow):** Parity of the result or overflow.
- Bit 1. **N (Subtract):** Indicates subtraction.
- Bit 0. **C (Carry):** Set if the last operation resulted in a carry out or borrow into the high order bit.

#### Control and Status Registers
- **I (Interrupt Vector):** Holds the base address for interrupt vectoring.
- **R (Memory Refresh):** Used for dynamic memory refresh.

#### Shadow Registers

- **Alternate Accumulator and Flags (A', F')**: An alternate set of accumulator and flag registers, enabling quick context switches during interrupts.
- **Alternate General-Purpose Registers (B', C', D', E', H', L')**: A complementary set of registers for temporary storage during interrupt service routines or other critical operations, allowing the main program context to be preserved.
- **Usage**: Primarily used in interrupt service routines to save processing time by avoiding the need to save and restore the main registers.
- **Switching Mechanism**: The `EXX` and `EX AF, AF'` instructions are used to swap between the main and shadow register sets.



### Addressing Modes

#### Immediate Addressing Mode

The `EX` instructions involving `(SP)` offer unique ways to interact with the stack not seen in the 6502 architecture.

## Useful Tips

### General Tips
- **Utilize Comments**: Enhance code readability and maintenance by adding comments to explain the purpose of blocks of code or specific instructions.
- **Flag Management**: Pay close attention to the flag effects of instructions, especially the carry (C) and zero (Z) flags, as they are crucial for conditional branching and arithmetic operations.
- **Leverage Stack Operations**: Use stack instructions (`PUSH`, `POP`, etc.) to preserve and restore register states during subroutine calls. This is vital for managing data and return addresses.
- **Optimize Data Access**: Make effective use of the Indexed (`IX`, `IY`) and Register Indirect (`HL`, `BC`, `DE`) addressing modes for efficient data manipulation and access.
- **Efficient Looping and Branching**: Implement loops and conditional branches (`JP`, `JR`, `CALL`, `RET` with conditions) to control the flow of your program smartly. Utilize counter registers (`BC`, `DE`, `HL`) and flags for loop control.
- **Use Interrupts Wisely**: Understand and properly configure interrupt modes (IM 0, IM 1, IM 2) for responsive and efficient interrupt handling.
- **Memory Management**: Be aware of the Z80 memory layout and capabilities, including the use of shadow registers and the refresh register (`R`) for dynamic memory management.
- **Optimization**: Aim for code optimization by choosing the shortest or fastest instructions for a given task, considering the trade-offs between execution speed and program size.
