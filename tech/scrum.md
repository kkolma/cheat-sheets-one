## Roles

### Scrum Team
- Team is cross-functional and consists of 5-9 people
- There are no set project roles within the team
- Team defines tasks and assignments
- Team is self-organizing and self-managing
- Maintains the Sprint Backlog
- Conducts the Sprint Review

### Product Owner (PO)
- Accountable for product success
- Defines all product features
- Responsible for prioritizing product features
- Maintains the Product Backlog
- Insures team working on highest valued features

### Scrum Master (SM)
- Holds daily 15 minute team meeting (Daily Scrum) 
- Removes obstacles
- Shields the team from external interference
- Maintains the Sprint Burndown Chart
- Conducts Sprint Retrospective at the end of a Sprint
- Is a facilitator not a manager 

## Artifacts

### Product Backlog - (PB)
- List of all desired product features
- List can contain bugs and non-functional items
- Product Owner responsible for prioritizing
- Items can be added by anyone at anytime
- Each item should have a business value assigned
- Maintained by the Product Owner

### Sprint Backlog – (SB)
- To-do list (also known as Backlog item) for the Sprint
- Created by the Scrum Team
- Product Owner has defined as highest priority

### Burndown Chart – (BC)
- Chart showing how much work remaining in a Sprint
- Calculated in hours remaining
- Maintained by the Scrum Master daily

### Release Backlog – (RB)
- Same as the Product Backlog. May involve one or
more sprints dependent on determined Release date

#### “DONE”= Potentially Shippable!

### Process

Sprint Planning -> Product Backlog -> Sprint Backlog -> Daily Scrum -> Sprint Review -> Sprint Shippable Product -> Sprint Retrospective

## Tools

### Task Board
- White Board containing teams Sprint goals backlog items tasks tasks in progress “DONE” items and the daily Sprint Burndown chart.
- Scrum meeting best held around task board
- Visible to everyone 


## Meetings

### Sprint Planning – Day 1 / First Half
- Product backlog prepared prior to meeting
- First half – Team selects items committing to complete
- Additional discussion of PB occurs during actual Sprint

### Sprint Planning – Day 1 / Second Half
- Occurs after first half done – PO available for questions
- Team solely responsible for deciding how to build
- Tasks created / assigned – Sprint Backlog produced

### Daily Scrum
- Held every day during a Sprint
- Lasts 15 minutes
- Team members report to each other not Scrum Master
- Asks 3 questions during meeting
  - "What have you done since last daily scrum?"
  - "What will you do before the next daily scrum?"
  - "What obstacles are impeding your work?"
- Opportunity for team members to synchronize their work

### Sprint Review
- Team presents “done” code to PO and stakeholders
- Functionality not “done” is not shown
- Feedback generated - PB maybe reprioritized
- Scrum Master sets next Sprint Review

### Sprint Retrospective
- Attendees – SM and Team. PO is optional
- Questions – What went well and what can be improved?
- SM helps team in discovery – not provide answers

#### Visibility + Flexibility = Scrum

## Estimating

### User Stories
- A very high level definition of what the customer wants the system to do. 
- Each story is captured as a separate item on the Product Backlog
- User stories are NOT dependent on other stories
- Story Template: As a [**User**] I want [**function**] So  that [**desired result**].
- Story Example: As a user I want to print a recipe so that I can cook it.

### Story Points
- A simple way to initially estimate level of effort expected to develop
- Story points are a relative measure of feature difficulty
- Usually scored on a scale of 1-10. 1=very easy through 10=very difficult
- Example: “Send to a Friend” Story Points = 2, “Shopping Cart” Story Points = 9

### Business Value
- Each User Story in the Product Backlog should have a corresponding business value assigned. 
- Typically assign (LMH) Low Medium High
- PO prioritizes Backlog items by highest value

### Estimate Team Capacity
- Capacity = # Teammates (Productive Hrs x Sprint Days) 
- Example – Team size is 4 Productive Hrs are 5 Sprint length is 30 days.
- Capacity = 4 (5 x30) = 600 hours
- NOTE:  Account for vacation time during the Sprint!

### Velocity
- The rate at which team converts items to “DONE” in a single Sprint – Usually calculated in Story Points.
