## Introduction
### Overview
Intermittent fasting (IF) involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting. This method can help manage weight, improve metabolic health, and potentially extend lifespan. Dr. Mindy Pelz’s approach tailors fasting schedules to women’s hormonal cycles.

### Benefits of Fasting
- Weight management
- Improved insulin sensitivity
- Enhanced mental clarity
- Increased energy levels
- Cellular repair and autophagy

## Understanding Hormonal Cycles
### Phases of the Menstrual Cycle

- **Ovulation Phase**: Typically occurs mid-cycle, around day 14.
- **Luteal Phase**: Post-ovulation phase lasting until the start of menstruation.
- **Menstrual Phase**: The shedding of the uterine lining.

### Hormonal Changes and Fasting
- **Estrogen Rise**: During the follicular phase, higher estrogen levels can enhance the benefits of fasting.
- **Progesterone Increase**: In the luteal phase, higher progesterone levels may require adjustments in fasting practices.
