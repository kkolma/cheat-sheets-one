This Pool Care Cheat Sheet provides essential tips for maintaining a clean and healthy pool, covering circulation, cleaning, and chemical balance. It includes formulas for calculating pool volume, a seasonal shopping list, a weekly maintenance schedule, safety tips, and useful links for more information. Perfect for new and experienced pool owners alike, it simplifies pool maintenance to ensure a safe and enjoyable swimming experience.

## Circulation

### Empty Skimmer Baskets
- Keep the skimmer and pump basket(s) clear.
- This improves water flow to the filter system.

### Adjust The Return Jets
- Angle down and point them all in the same direction.
- This pushes debris to the surface for the skimmer(s).
- It also helps mix in chemicals.

### Run The Filter & Pump
- Run the system for 8-12 hours a day. The longer the better.
  - **Warm and Hot Climates**: 8-12 Hours a Day
  - **Cool and Cold Climates**: 4-6 Hours a Day

### Monitor Filter Pressure
- Filter pressure is usually 10-20 PSI.
- Backwash (or clean) when it is up 10 PSI.

## Cleaning

### 1. Skim The Surface Daily
- This stops debris from sinking to the bottom and less to vacuum.
- Skim with the flow of the water in a circular motion.

### 2. Vacuum Weekly
- Vacuuming helps improve water circulation and keeps the floor of the pool clean.
- Invest in an automatic pool cleaner to make this process easy and efficient.

### 3. Brush Twice a Week
- Brush the walls, ladders, and hard-to-reach places.
- Brush toward the floor.

## Chemistry

### 1. Test The Water Weekly
- Using test strips or a liquid test kit to test the water.
- Check for pH, Alkalinity, and sanitizer levels.
- Add chemicals if needed.

### 2. Balance The Water
- First, adjust alkalinity with alkalinity increaser (baking soda).
- Then test the water again to see if still pH needs adjusting.
- Use pH increaser or decreaser to adjust pH to the ideal range.
  - **Alkalinity**: 100 - 150 ppm
  - **Ideal pH**: 7.5

### 3. Add Sanitizer Weekly
- Add the proper amount of sanitizer needed to achieve the ideal level.
  - **Chlorine**: 1 - 3 ppm
  - **POOL MAXX**: 30 - 50 ppm *(for saltwater pools)*

### 4. Shock Every 1-2 Weeks
- Shock your pool with the proper amount at night. Run the pool for at least 8 hours.
- We can use chlorine or POOL MAXX to shock the pool.

#### Shock Your Pool with Chlorine
1. Dilute with water.
2. Add shock slowly.
3. Stir slowly to dissolve.
4. Pour around pool.
5. Run filter overnight.
6. Test water.

#### Shock Your Pool with POOL MAXX
1. Pour around pool.
2. Run filter overnight.
3. Test water.


## Calculating Your Pool Size
### Square or Rectangular Pools (Single Depth)
- Formula: Length x Width x Depth x 7.5 = Volume in Gallons
- Example: 24' x 12' x 4' x 7.5 = 8,640 gallons

### Square or Rectangular Pools (Multiple Depths)
**Gradual Depth Change:**
- Formula: Length x Width x Average Depth x 7.5 = Volume in Gallons
- Average Depth: (Shallow End Depth + Deep End Depth) / 2
- Example: (3' + 8') / 2 = 5.5', then 32' x 16' x 5.5' x 7.5 = 21,120 gallons

**Drop-off:**
- Treat as two separate pools.
- Example: Shallow end: 5' x 15' x 3' x 7.5 = 1,687.5 gallons
- Deep end: 5' x 15' x 8' x 7.5 = 4,500 gallons
- Total: 1,687.5 + 1,687.5 + 4,500 = 7,875 gallons

### Round Pools
- Formula: Pi x Radius² x Average Depth x 7.5 = Volume in Gallons
- Example: Diameter 24', Depth 4'
- Radius = 24' / 2 = 12'
- Radius² = 12' x 12' = 144'
- Volume: 3.14 x 144' x 4' x 7.5 = 13,564.8 gallons

## Additional Tips for New Pool Owners
### Springtime Shopping List
- **Sanitizer**: Chlorine tablets, salt, bromine, or biguanide sanitizer.
- **Shock and Algaecides**: Season’s supply of oxidizing shock products and algaecides.
- **Alkalinity and Calcium Hardness Increaser**: About 1 pound per 1,000 gallons.
- **pH Increaser and Decreaser**: Small container of both.
- **CYA (Cyanuric Acid)**: At least 5 pounds.
- **Test Strips and Filter Media**: New test strips and filter media (e.g., diatomaceous earth or sand).

### Weekly Maintenance Schedule
- **Test Your Water**: Weekly, typically on Sunday.
- **Add Shock and Algaecide**: Right after testing.
- **Vacuum Your Pool**: Weekly.
- **Brush Down the Pool**: After vacuuming.
- **Skim the Surface**: As often as needed.
- **Clean Your Baskets**: At least twice a week.
- **Check Filter Pressure**: Weekly, especially for DE filters.

### Safety Tips
- **Secure the Pool Area**: Use fences, gates, and covers to prevent accidents.
- **Proper Storage of Chemicals**: Store chemicals in a cool, dry place, away from children and pets.
- **Supervise Children**: Always supervise children around the pool.

### Seasonal Maintenance
- **Spring Opening**: Remove cover, clean the pool, balance chemicals.
- **Winterizing**: Lower water level, add winterizing chemicals, cover the pool.

### Water Level
- **Check Regularly**: Maintain proper water level for optimal circulation and equipment function.
