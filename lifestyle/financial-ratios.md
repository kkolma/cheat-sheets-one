Certainly! Let's continue with the Liquidity Ratios section, providing the "Purpose" and "Example" for each ratio.

## Liquidity Ratios
### Current Ratio
- **Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- **Purpose:** Assesses a company's ability to pay off its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. A higher ratio indicates better liquidity.
- **Example:** If current assets are $200,000 and current liabilities are $100,000, the current ratio is 2.0, indicating sufficient liquidity to cover short-term obligations twice over.

### Quick Ratio
- **Formula:** (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
- **Purpose:** Provides a more stringent measure of liquidity than the current ratio by excluding inventory, which is not as easily convertible to cash.
- **Example:** With current assets of $200,000, inventory of $50,000, and current liabilities of $100,000, the quick ratio is 1.5, suggesting good liquidity but factoring out less liquid inventory.

### Cash Ratio
- **Formula:** (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities
- **Purpose:** Measures the ability of a company to pay off its short-term liabilities with only its cash and cash equivalents, offering the most conservative view of liquidity.
- **Example:** If cash and cash equivalents are $80,000 and current liabilities are $100,000, the cash ratio is 0.8, indicating reliance on cash reserves to cover most short-term obligations.

### Defensive Interval Ratio
- **Formula:** (Cash + Marketable Securities + Receivables) / Daily Operational Expenses
- **Purpose:** Estimates how many days a company can continue to operate without needing to access additional funding or sales.
- **Example:** With cash, marketable securities, and receivables totaling $120,000, and daily operational expenses of $1,000, the DIR is 120 days, suggesting solid short-term financial stability.

### Times Interest Earned Ratio
- **Formula:** EBIT / Interest Expense
- **Purpose:** Assesses a company's ability to cover its interest expenses with its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). A higher ratio indicates more comfortable coverage.
- **Example:** If EBIT is $50,000 and interest expense is $10,000, the TIE ratio is 5, showing that the company can cover its interest expenses 5 times over with its operating income.

### Times Interest Earned (Cash Basis) Ratio
- **Formula:** (Operating Cash Flow + Interest Paid + Taxes Paid) / Interest Paid
- **Purpose:** Measures the ability to cover interest payments with cash flow from operations, offering a cash-focused perspective on interest coverage.
- **Example:** With operating cash flow of $70,000, interest paid of $10,000, and taxes paid of $15,000, the TIE (Cash Basis) ratio is 8.5, indicating strong coverage of interest by operational cash flows.

### CAPEX to Operating Cash Ratio
- **Formula:** CAPEX / Operating Cash Flow
- **Purpose:** Evaluates how much of the company's operating cash flow is being used for capital expenditures, providing insight into the company's investment in long-term assets versus available cash.
- **Example:** If CAPEX is $40,000 and operating cash flow is $100,000, the ratio is 0.4, indicating 40% of operating cash is invested in capital assets.

### Operating Cash Flow Ratio
- **Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities
- **Purpose:** Measures the adequacy of a company's operating cash flow in covering its short-term liabilities, indicating operational liquidity.
- **Example:** With operating cash flow of $100,000 and current liabilities of $50,000, the ratio is 2, demonstrating strong operational liquidity with the ability to cover short-term liabilities twice over.



## Valuation Ratios
### Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
- **Formula:** Market Value per Share / Earnings per Share (EPS)
- **Purpose:** Measures the market's valuation of a company relative to its earnings. A higher P/E ratio may indicate expectations of higher future growth.
- **Example:** If the market value per share is $50 and the EPS is $5, the P/E ratio is 10. This means investors are willing to pay $10 for every $1 of earnings.

### EV/EBITDA Ratio
- **Formula:** Enterprise Value / EBITDA
- **Purpose:** Compares a company's total valuation to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. It provides a valuation metric that is less influenced by accounting practices and capital structure.
- **Example:** With an enterprise value of $200 million and EBITDA of $25 million, the EV/EBITDA ratio is 8, suggesting the company is valued at 8 times its EBITDA.

### EV/EBIT Ratio
- **Formula:** Enterprise Value / EBIT
- **Purpose:** Similar to EV/EBITDA but includes the effects of depreciation and amortization, offering insight into how the market values the company's operating performance after accounting for these non-cash expenses.
- **Example:** If the enterprise value is $300 million and EBIT is $30 million, the EV/EBIT ratio is 10, indicating the company's enterprise value is 10 times its operating earnings.

### EV/Revenue Ratio
- **Formula:** Enterprise Value / Revenue
- **Purpose:** Measures a company's total valuation relative to its revenue, providing a perspective on how the market values the company's sales. Useful for comparing companies that may not yet be profitable.
- **Example:** With an enterprise value of $500 million and revenue of $100 million, the EV/Revenue ratio is 5, indicating the company is valued at 5 times its revenue.
