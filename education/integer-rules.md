This Integer Rules Cheat Sheet is a comprehensive guide designed to demystify the fundamentals of integers, their operations, and properties for learners of all levels. Starting with "[The Basics](#the-basics)," it covers integer definitions, the concept of absolute values, the significance of zero, and techniques for comparing and ordering integers. The sheet progresses to "[Integer Operations](#integer-operations)," explaining the rules for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing integers, including handling division exceptions. Additionally, it delves into "[Integer Properties](#integer-properties)" such as the commutative, associative, and distributive properties, rounding off with "[Advanced Topics](#advanced-topics)" that introduce prime and composite numbers, as well as even and odd integers, and simple factorization. This cheat sheet serves as a quick reference to understand and apply integer rules in mathematical problems efficiently.


## The Basics
### Integers
**[Integer definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer)**: A set of positive and negative whole numbers, including zero. They can be represented on a number line.

### THE NUMBER LINE
| Negative Numbers | 0 | Positive Numbers |
|------------------|---|------------------|
|-5 -4  -3 -2 -1         | 0 | 1 2 3 4 5          |

### Absolute Value
The distance a number is from zero on the number line. An absolute value is never negative. 
Examples: 
- | -5 | = 5 
- | 5 | = 5

### Negative of a Number
- **Definition**: The negative of a number is its value on the opposite side of zero on the number line.
- **Notation**: Denoted by a minus (-) sign in front of the number.
- **Rule**:
  - The negative of a positive number is negative.
  - The negative of a negative number is positive.
- **Examples**:
  - Negative of +5 is -5.
  - Negative of -3 is +3.
- **Zero**: The negative of 0 is 0 itself.

### The Sign of Zero

- **Neutral**: Zero is neither positive nor negative.
- **Identity Element**: In addition, zero acts as an identity element; any number plus zero is the number itself.
- **Multiplicative Effect**: Any number multiplied by zero equals zero.


### Comparing and Ordering Integers

- **Direction**: Numbers to the right are greater, to the left are smaller.
- **Zero**: The dividing point; positive numbers are greater than zero, negative numbers are less.
- **Comparison**:
  - Use "<" (less than) or ">" (greater than) to compare.
  - Example: -3 < 2 (read as "-3 is less than 2").
- **Ordering**:
  - Arrange from smallest to largest or vice versa.
  - Example: -5, -2, 0, 1, 3


## Integer Operations
### ADDING INTEGERS

#### SAME SIGN
Add and Keep the Sign!

- Add the absolute value of the numbers and keep the same sign.
  - (positive) + (positive) = Positive
    - (+4) + (+5) = +9
  - (negative) + (negative) = Negative
    - (-4) + (-5) = -9

#### DIFFERENT SIGNS
Subtract and Keep the Sign of the Bigger Number!

- Subtract the absolute value of the numbers and keep the sign of the bigger number.
  - (-4) + (+5) = +1
  - (+4) + (-5) = -1

### MULTIPLYING INTEGERS

#### SAME SIGNS
- POSITIVE
  - Multiply the numbers. Answer will be positive.
    - (-5) × (-5) = +25

#### DIFFERENT SIGNS
- NEGATIVE
  - Multiply the numbers. Answer will be negative
    - (+5) × (-5) = -25

### SUBTRACTING INTEGERS

Do not subtract integers. You must change the signs: "Add the Opposite"

- **KEEP**- Keep the sign of the first number
- **CHANGE**- Change the subtraction sign to addition
- **CHANGE**- Change the sign of the second number to the opposite sign. If it is positive- change to negative. If it is negative- change to positive. 
  - (+4) – (-4) becomes (+4) + (+4) = 8

### DIVIDING INTEGERS

#### SAME SIGNS
- POSITIVE 
  - Divide the numbers. Answer will be positive.
    - (-5) ÷ (-5) = +1

#### DIFFERENT SIGNS
- NEGATIVE
  - Divide the numbers. Answer will be negative 
    - (+5) ÷ (-5) = -1

#### Integer Division Exceptions

- **Fraction Results**: When dividing two integers does not result in a whole number, the result is a fraction or a decimal. Example: \(7 \div 2 = 3.5\).
- **Dividing by Zero**: Division by zero is undefined. It's a rule in mathematics that you cannot divide a number by zero.

## Integer Properties
### Commutative Property

- **Addition**: a + b = b + a
  - Example: 3 + (-5) = (-5) + 3
- **Multiplication**: a * b = b * a
  - Example: (-4) * 2 = 2 * (-4)

### Associative Property

- **Addition**: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
  - Example: (3 + 4) + (-2) = 3 + (4 + (-2))
- **Multiplication**: (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)
  - Example: (-3 * 2) * 4 = -3 * (2 * 4)

### Distributive Property

- The sum of two numbers times a third number is equal to the sum of each addend times the third number.
  - a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c
  - Example: 2 * (3 + (-4)) = 2 * 3 + 2 * (-4)

### Identity Property

- **Addition**: Adding zero to any integer does not change its value.
  - a + 0 = a
  - Example: (-5) + 0 = -5
- **Multiplication**: Multiplying any integer by one does not change its value.
  - a * 1 = a
  - Example: 7 * 1 = 7

### Inverse Property

- **Addition**: For every integer a, there exists an integer -a such that a + (-a) = 0.
  - Example: 5 + (-5) = 0
- **Multiplication**: For every nonzero integer a, there exists a reciprocal 1/a such that a * 1/a = 1. (Note: This is more relevant for rational numbers rather than just integers, as the reciprocal of an integer may not be an integer unless a = ±1.)

## Advanced topics
### Prime and Composite Numbers

- **Prime Numbers**: Integers greater than 1 that have only two divisors: 1 and themselves.
  - Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7.
- **Composite Numbers**: Integers that have more than two divisors.
  - Examples: 4, 6, 8, 9.
- **Special Case**: 1 is neither prime nor composite.

### Even and Odd Integers

- **Even Integers**: Integers divisible by 2. They end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
  - Examples: -4, 0, 2, 6.
- **Odd Integers**: Integers not divisible by 2. They end in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.
  - Examples: -3, 1, 5, 7.

### Simple Factorization

- **Definition**: Breaking down an integer into a product of its factors.
- **Purpose**: To identify all integers that divide evenly into the original number.
- **Example**: The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.
  - 6 can be represented as 1 * 6 or 2 * 3.
