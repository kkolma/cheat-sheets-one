- Somatization: transforming unacknowledged needs (e.g., dependence) into physical symptoms as a way to have needs met without acknowledging them.
- Acting Out: avoiding unacceptable affects or impulses by engaging in a flurry of diversionary activity.
- Blocking: a temporary stopping of thoughts or feelings as a protection against them.

## Cognitive Distortions

### All-Or-Nothing Thinking
Seeing things in categories of all-good or all-bad. Performance that is less than perfect is interpreted as a complete failure.

### Overgeneralizing
Generalizing a single negative event into a larger never-ending pattern of defeat.

### Negative Mental Filter
Dwelling on negative details to the exclusion of positive aspects, even when the positive aspects are more prominent.

### Disqualifying The Positive
Rejecting positive experiences by insisting they "don't count." For instance, handling an interpersonal challenge effectively and maturely but concluding that it was “just luck.”

### Jumping To Conclusions
Interpreting events negatively even though there is little evidence to support the negative assessment.

### Mind Reading
Believing that others hold a negative view of you without confirming this belief or entertaining alternate explanations. For example, thinking your boss is angry with you because he didn’t say “Hi.” His behavior in fact may have been unrelated to you, perhaps related to preoccupation with financial problems.

### The Fortuneteller Error
Predicting the future in a negative way as if it were preordained to turn out badly.

### Catastrophizing
Exaggerating the importance of negative events until they are seen as overwhelming. This increases a person’s sense of helplessness and hopelessness.

### Emotional Reasoning
Believing that your negative emotions reflect the state of the world. For instance, when depressed, believing that the world is “going to hell in a hand basket.”

### Essentializing
Seeing setbacks as a reflection of your core self. Rather than thinking, “I made a mistake,” you think, "I'm a loser." This distortion also occurs when assessing others. For instance, if someone forgets your name, concluding, “He’s such a self-centered and shallow guy.”

### Personalizing
Believing yourself to be the cause of external negative events, even though it is unlikely you are responsible for them. For instance, when your parents argue, concluding that it’s your fault. This distortion is particularly common among people raised or living with an abusive parent or spouse or with a substance abuser.
