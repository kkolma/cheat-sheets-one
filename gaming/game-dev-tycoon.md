Whether you're a beginner or looking to enhance your gameplay, this cheat sheet is your go-to resource for all things '*Game Dev Tycoon*'.

## Management Strategies
### Staff Management
- **Hiring Strategy**: Hire slowly to keep overhead low, and look for employees with high potential stats. Early on, focus on versatile employees who can handle multiple roles until your income supports specialists.
- **Training**: Regular training is crucial. Use the "Training" menu options wisely, focusing on increasing Design or Technology points based on the role. Prioritize "Game Dev Gems" and "Code Jam" for boosting specific skills.
- **Team Composition**: Initially aim for a small, balanced team. As your funds increase, diversify your team with specialists to improve game quality and manage larger projects.

### Financial Management
- **Budgeting**: Allocate budget based on game scale—don't overspend on small games. Save major investments like top-tier marketing or new engines for high-potential games.
- **Risk Management**: Keep a reserve fund for at least two game projects to buffer against any flops. Gradually increase game complexity and budget as your studio grows.
- **Revenue Strategies**: Consider medium games with good combos and marketing to steadily build funds before attempting blockbuster AAA games.

### Sequel Strategy
- **Timing and Selection**: Wait for game technology to improve or for significant fan demand before releasing a sequel. Use player feedback and game performance data to inform changes and improvements in sequels.
- **Innovation vs. Consistency**: Balance introducing new features with maintaining core mechanics that fans loved in the original to keep sequels fresh yet familiar.

### Marketing Strategies
- **Early Stage**: Use magazines and demos for early-stage marketing when budget is tight. They provide a good ROI for smaller games.
- **Growth Stage**: As your studio grows, invest in larger marketing campaigns like global marketing and prime time TV spots for major releases to maximize visibility.
- **Tailored Marketing**: Match marketing scale and type with the anticipated game size and audience reach. Don't waste money on massive campaigns for niche games.

### Crisis Management
- **Post-Flop Analysis**: Review game reports and user feedback to understand what went wrong. Was it a poor topic-genre combo, bad timing, or underdeveloped features?
- **Recovery Plan**: Cut costs temporarily, focus on smaller, less risky projects to recover financially, and rebuild fan trust with high-quality releases.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Learn from each failure by iteratively tweaking game formulas and production processes.

### Platform-Specific Strategies
- **Platform Selection**: Choose platforms based on the target audience and genre strength. E.g., action games perform well on consoles, while simulations and strategy games excel on PC.
- **Timing**: Pay attention to the life cycle of platforms. Developing for a new platform early can capture new audiences but comes with risks of lower initial user bases.

### Expansion Pack and DLC Management
- **Timing of Release**: Release DLC or expansions when interest starts to wane but while the base game still has a strong player base.
- **Content Value**: Ensure DLC adds meaningful content—new storylines, features, or gameplay mechanics to justify the cost and keep players engaged.

### Community Engagement
- **Active Interaction**: Regular updates, behind-the-scenes posts, and active responses to community feedback help build a loyal fanbase.
- **Fan Involvement**: Involve the community in some game development decisions, like voting on new features, game titles, or content additions.
